# Data-Science-projects
A collection of interesting Data Science Projects that highlight the foundational understanding of SQL, Python and it's libraries 

SQL PROJECTS

1. Analysing international debt statistics

Skills tested: Foundational understaning of SQL queries

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is the organization that provides debt to countries.
In this project, we are going to analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:
What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?
The prerequisite for this project is Intro to SQL for Data Science.

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

PYTHON PROJECTS

1. The discovery of handwash project

Skills tested: Importing & cleaning data in Python, data manipulation with Python, data visualization with python's matplotlib, foundational understanding of statistics & probability.

Project description : In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

2. GoT network analysis project

Skills tested: Network analysis in Python, foundational understanding of pandas

Project description :Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!
In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). We will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.

3. SEM with Python

Skills tested: Intermediate level knowledge of python, foundational understanding of data science principles

Project description :In this case study, we work for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. We are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. With our Python skills, we will efficiently create these keywords!
The most important task in structuring a search engine marketing account is mapping the right keywords to the right ads and making sure they send users to the right landing pages. Having figured that out is a big part of the account setup and makes the life of the account manager much easier.

4. Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency market

Skills tested: Pandas foundation, cleaning data in python, manipulating dataframes with pandas

Project description :To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies we will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.
Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

5. Exploring 67 years of LEGO

Skills tested: Pandas foundation, manipulating dataframes with pandas

Project description :The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, we will get to explore the Rebrickable database.
