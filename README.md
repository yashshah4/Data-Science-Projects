# Data-Science-projects
A collection of interesting Data Science Projects that highlight my foundational understanding of python and it's packages 

1. The discovery of handwash project

Skills tested: Importing & cleaning data in Python, data manipulation with Python, data visualization with python's matplotlib, foundational understanding of statistics & probability.

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.

2. GoT network analysis project

Skills tested: Network analysis in Python, foundational understanding of pandas

Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this!In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). We will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.
