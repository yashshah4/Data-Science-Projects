Skills tested: Importing & cleaning data in Python, data manipulation with Python, data visualization with python's matplotlib, foundational understanding of statistics & probability.

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis makes a breakthough discovery: He discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.
In this python project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected.
