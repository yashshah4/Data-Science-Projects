    This is my first Apple Watch, and I bought this mainly because of the EKG and the other sensors. I wanted to buy the Series 4 but the Apple discontinued, so I took the Series 5 and thanks to the Amazon I could save around $55 on it (gift card refill bonus - $10, prime now first order coupon code - $10, amazon credit card 5% bonus - $20 and the cheeper base price - 15$). :D

    Screen broke and cracked.  The watch bezel is not very robust. It won‚Äôt take much if any abuse. Be sure to pay an extra $79 for Apple Care plus $69 for each of the 2 support issues. the iWatch 2 and iWatch 3 had cracking issues. The watch 5 is prone to crack. The iWatch 5 GPS with Cellular is not a keeper. Infact it‚Äôs a disposable watch once broken. Apple engineered it so it can‚Äôt be fixed. It looks like I‚Äôm out $360 for the repair or I‚Äôm selling the cracked iWatch 5 on Craigslist for $80. Another piece of Apple Junk  don‚Äôt buy this product it‚Äôs not well made and can‚Äôt be repaired. Only replaced. CHINESE JUNK.

    I REALLY love the various heart monitoring apps that this one does! I have had some heart issues, and the heartrate and EKG options reassure me.It is also at least as good as the Fitbit for things like keeping track of steps.Plus, it tells the time! LOL!It is a bit tricky to figure out at first, and also has very little documentation on how to use it... but it's not all that hard to figure out, plus there is lots of info online about how to do various things.Mine does require a connection to an iphone; this may be an issue if you do not have one.Still- while I am still playing around with the options- I do love it!

    If you have a wrist tattoo don‚Äôt even bother with the Apple watch. I‚Äôve tried the last three versions and the watch just constantly asks for my passcode. The watch can‚Äôt read through a tattoo making wrist detection unavailable. Apple has known about this since the very first Apple Watch but they apparently don‚Äôt care enough to fix the issue.

    I just got this to replace my versa Fitbit, as far as a swim tracker goes this watch is a joke. I swim daily as part of my fitness routine and like to track my lap pace. This doesn‚Äôt track accurately at all, I do like the heart rate tracking it does but that‚Äôs about it. All the other features aren‚Äôt really important to me. So it‚Äôs going back.

    I love it. It's easy to use, beautiful, and very nice. I came from using a Fitbit ionic. The only downside is my Fitbit got days of battery life, but I have to charge this watch every night. But honestly I think that because it does so much more, its a fair tradeoff.

    I bought one apple watch 5 series for gift with gift card, but I gave it to my friend.  My friend also said that it was packed very badly and the Note on it was left very badly. I can not send it back as it is a gift for it, but I am very bad. I never expected.

    I was a long time Fitbit enthusiast and fan. Spent a good 5 years with the Fitbit Charge HR that served me really well and helped me lose significant weight. I literally ran it into the ground till it fell apart piece by piece and I had to upgrade. My options were to go for the new Versa 2 or the Apple Watch. Unforunately for Fitbit over their last 4-5 releases including the Versa 1 all of their reviews have been horrendous. People have complained about cheap quality, to syncing issues, to software issues and what not. And then I started seeing the early Versa 2 reviews come in and those were abyssmal as well. Therefore I ponied up a few extra benjamins and went for the AWS5And I am glad to say this thing does not disappoint. My biggest concern moving away from the Fitbit ecosystem to Apple was the stupid rings or at least I thought they were stupid. But I now find the ring system pretty good an intuitive. Some of the things that work very well for me are things such as extensive heart health analysis including HR recovery post workout. It has many other metrics and of course the ECG which is very helpful to know that your heart is operating in a good way. The one thing I don't like about the Apple Watch is its integration of food calories or rather its lack thereof. One thing I LOVED about the Fitbit was how it was all a one-stop-shop view for your food calories, your active calories, your exercise calories and sleep score etc. But in Apple you have to flip flop between a 3rd party app like Lose It or MyFitnessPal and then go into the Health App to see your health and heart stats and then the activity app to see your activity. You get my point, right? It just seems all over the place and very cubersome to go into 3 different things that you could do with one FitBit app.But that annoyance aside the AWS5 does so many things that are great. Its notifications are great. Its GPS is great. The way you can control music while being on a run is great. The stats it displays for things like a outside run or biking and even weight training is great. The HR monitor is very good and the Siri function (as dumb as she is) is very good on the Watch.Overall I am really liking this watch and have figured out a pretty good way to replicate my experience as close to what my experience was with Fitbit. I have to give kudos to Fitbit for creating a very seamless app experience for the fitness enthusiast. But with a little bit of research and finagling I have been able to get my AW experience pretty close to my FitBit app experience by using 3rd party apps such as Lose It and along with a host of extra features I am glad I went for the Apple Watch vs. the Versa 2 which seems to be getting bad reviews.

    This apple watch has been my everyday device since when I first received it. This has been a very useful device, especially when making/receiving phone calls when my phone isn't near. What I love the most about this watch compared to my old one the series 3 is the always-on display (First image is the always-on display and the second image is when the display is fully on) as I can look at the time anytime without fully turning on the display of the apple watch.However, when it boils down to sleep tracking it isn't the best at sleep tracking mainly because of the battery life as I get roughly 20% left before heading to sleep, I wake up at 5:30AM and end my day usually around 9-10PM. I wish the battery life lasted longer so I can use this watch as my sleep tracker and not needing to always charge it around 10PM as on weekends I tend to go out where I have to leave my watch at home.When it comes down to design I really like it a lot especially how the display is bigger compared to my series 3, the bad part is where the heart sensor is between the cracks it tends to get dirty where when cleaning it this can be a difficult task to clean as it's between the cracks where the heart sensor is and the body as shown in the image.Overall, I do like the series 5 and hopefully, they can improve their design when they release the new apple watch. I do recommend this product especially if you're buying this as a gift as this is a perfect gift for an iPhone user.

    I switched from Fitbit because of privacy concerns, but this watch isn‚Äôt good for fitness.  You can‚Äôt customise it,  the music doesn‚Äôt work with Spotify, even if songs are downloaded, it doesn‚Äôt keep your heart rate on the screen when exercising, and the steps are hidden in a secondary screen you have to scroll to.  This might be good for people who can‚Äôt live without seeing texts rog  away, but how the hell is it going to track sleep when you have to charge it every 10 hours?
