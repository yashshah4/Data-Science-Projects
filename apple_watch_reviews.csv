    So far I absolutely love this watch.  Really like the customizable face and really like the fact I can make and take calls!  Recommend it highly having replaced my Fitbit Versa lite with this watch.  All of my Iphone features on my wrist..what’s not to like? Glad I made this purchase.

    For the most part I really like my apple 5 watch. The one major thing I don't like is the water proof-ness. Because of the reviews etc I don’t wear it in the shower or while washing dishes. Kind of a disappointment there. 1 other thing I’ve noticed is the activity app is based on calories rather than steps. I would prefer a step goal rather than a caloric goal. I love how light it feels on my wrist. I like having access to messages and being able to reply quickly if my phone is in my purse. I like being able to customize it to fit my likes. I imagine I will always have an apple watch going forward.

    I love my Apple Watch! It is amazing! I love that it remind me to stand every hour and to move. I live being able to read and answer text messages and being able to see who is calling and answer the call through the watch if I’m not close to my phone!

    The new Series 5 watch is mostly great, it just has terrible battery life. Screen is brilliant and the new SOC makes this device a speed demon. The downside is the battery lasts maybe 18 hours where my previous Series 2 lasted nearly 48 hours.

    I was afraid of this watch not keeping a charge for the day.  But I really only use it to track sleep and track exercise.  My battery lasts all day without issue.  I do not have the background app refresh on all my apps.  I do get notifications on it but I am not using it all day so the screen is not on using the battery life.  I charged it this morning and 9 hours later the battery is at 78%.

    My dad is concerned about falling, so we asked him if he would wear an apple watch, he agreed. Within a week, my dad had a fall, fortunately, friends were with him. The watch asked him if he fell. When my dad said yes, it asked if he wanted the watch to call for help. He said no I have friends with me.

    First iwatch I’ve owned & it’s great. Very easy to figure out.  I like the fact that I can make/receive phone calls and text messages on my wrist when I can’t reach my phone.  Don’t need the cellular watch cause the Bluetooth works extremely well & is loud & clear for incoming & outgoing calls & text messages.  I don’t use the sleep tracking app cause I don’t sleep with the watch on. Battery life is good.  When I’m not wearing the watch it’s powered off so the life lasts a day or so.

    Coming from an Android Wear and Android phone background to an Apple Watch and iPhone.  The integration between watch and phone is so much better with the Apple products.  Apple Watch 5 is fast, extremely responsive and head and shoulders above the Fossil Sport I was using previously (with a Pixel 2XL).  It just works and works all the time.

    This is my first smart watch, in general. I don’t have much to compare it to. However, I love how I can stay connected to calls and messages while at work (“no cell phones” policy). Also, it has motivated me to be more active and increase my “step count.”

    This is not a watch. You get phone calls on it, talk to it, get messages, get news headlines and stories. It monitors your cardio, prompts you to walk even breath, and is a great golf GPS. Tells the date, the weather, and even the time. This is not a “watch”.

    I resisted and resisted.  A watch was to tell time and that was the only thing I needed one for.  Who wanted to be bothered with charging, syncing, Bluetooth connections and basically managing another high maintenance device?  Not this guy.  Then my sister bought me a Pebble.  Hard to imagine a more dysfunctional product, but it did tell the time and held a charge for up to a month with an always-on clockface.  Getting alerts on my watch was handy...when it worked.  Went through several upgrade cycles with Pebble until they went under, then moved on to Fitbit Versa.  More functionality, but much worse battery life (5 days) and the watch face was not always on...another dysfunctional product.When the Versa broke, I did consider the Versa 2.  It seemed to have a lot of the same issues as the original.  Then I saw that the Apple Series 5 had an always-on clock face and I jumped in.  I wont give you the most technical review, as that can be googled quickly anywhere.  What I can do is give the perspective of someone upgrading from the Pebble/Versa environment.What the Series 5 brings that is the most significant is the always-on clock face.  As a physician in patient rooms, the worst thing you can do is deliberately lift up your arm to get your watch to come alive to see the time or look at pages or texts (figuratively speaking, actually a lot worse things can be done).  I have not once done this and not had someone comment that they thought they were wasting my time, so I just stopped checking my watch.  Always on is a social must-have feature, or you are that douchy guy who is obviously checking the time while talking to people.  On the Versa the motion needed to turn on was so poorly designed and deliberate that you would have to repeatedly and deliberately flick your wrist to see the time.  I am so glad that thing broke.  Other cool but less important features include a really good compass and women's health tracker.  I'm sure that there are plenty of dudes out there like me who like to pretend to have a cycle and track it on our watches so...just sayin.  Bonus.Not going to get into all of the other heath features which are not new to this model.  The fitness tracker is cool and auto-detects activity quite well.  Apple still trails Fitbit in sleep tracking, though.  The battery is new in some way.  Tear downs show a new design which likely helps to account for the same battery life with the always-on screen.  I want at least a week of charge though.  Let's go, Apple.Compared to the Versa, Fossil and others, this is just a polished, well made device.  The quality is apparent immediately.  The 40mm version is a thin, appropriate wrist size.  IMO the 44mm just looks too big and bulky.  The band is really comfortable and super easy to swap out.  The connection to iPhone is perfect - no disconnects and really excellent haptics.  I have yet to explore all of the apps and features but navigating the watch is no different than an iPhone with regard to gestures - swipe down for alerts, swipe up for control center.Pros:- Always on display!!!- Thinner than Series 4 - not as bulky- Handsome, solid, quality build and feel- Perfect iPhone integration and connection- Great haptics- Intuitive controls- Really comfy band which is one touch on/off - no fussing with the band.  Great design.Cons:- Cost (relative to others)- Battery life - charge it every night- Screen scratches easily - get a screen protectorFinal word:  I am really glad that my Versa is sitting in a midden pile decomposing.  I regret that I did not get an Apple Watch sooner - although always on was the deal-maker for me.  Battery life is still low and there is now yet another device to manage charging for, but if you can deal with that then there is no reason to buy a different smart watch.Update:  I purchased a very handy nightstand device for charging my phone and watch.  The watch is so easy to pop on and off and just drop onto the stand that the charging issue is really a non-issue, much to my surprise.  Now when I charge my phone at night, which i routinely do, the watch drops right alongside it.  Easy peasy.Update #2: Still love the watch.  I was playing with my dog on a tile floor when I heard a crunch.  Lifted the watch to see a bunch of deep scratches on the glass.  Checked online and replacing the screen is a $300 affair.  I am going to try to polish it out, but for god sake use a screen protector.TIP - Scratch removal: Not really part of the review, but I could not find any decent way to get the scratches out of the watch surface.  After about 3 weeks and multiple different products and trials, practicing on old watches, I finally was successful with a technique using a Dremel, felt pad, auto sandpaper (600 down to 3000 grit) and Cerium Oxide.  It was actually quite easy once I got it.  Very smooth surface - not factory smooth, but smooth.  Happy to coach anyone through it if wanted.  Buy a $10 watch and practice on that first.

    Everything about this watch is wonderful. I went from the series one to this one (series five). There’s a major difference in speed as there should be. Very comfortable. Comes with 2 bands, charger cube and cord. I bought a protective case for the watch face since I’ll be using my watch while I work. Absolutely No complaints about this watch.

    I just purchased this watch to replace my Fitbit Versa that replaced by Apple Watch from 2016. I hated the Fitbit, but made due with it until I could purchase this watch. I am happy to be back on the Apple circuit, although I do want to share my initial frustration with the watch. The battery ran down super fast on the first two days that I had it, to the point it was running through about 10% per hour and died on me during a workout. I was about ready to head to Apple to complain but I gave it one more day and it started working great on the third day after a full charge from O%. Point is, if you are having an issue with the battery, give it a couple of days. Now I am super happy with the switch back and am loving the new watch, with great battery life!

    I’m upgrading from a Series 1, so I was bound to be impressed. With that being said, much faster, nice to have the bigger screen, and the always on screen is really helpful. It always took a tap to wake the screen on my Series 1, so nice to be able to just glance down at the time.

    I was going to leave a one star review and try to return my watch after five days of having it because the battery life was absolutely ridiculous. It only lasted 9hrs max. Before I left the review I decide to check for an update just in case. There was an update and even though fixing battery life wasn’t listed in the list of fixes it completely changed the battery life and some other bugs I was experiencing. I can see my watch lasting about two days now. Only four stars because the layout of the health app/activity app suck compared to the Fitbit app. I miss the Fitbit app and battery life of my charge 3 but it’s awesome to have the added capabilities of the Apple Watch.  The Apple Watch tracks less calories burned and less steps than my Fitbit did but I feel like it is more accurate.

    I’ve gone from (automatic) mechanicals & a g-shock, to my first Apple Watch. I work in manufacturing and knew that this watch would come in quite handy. So far, I’m loving the Noise app (hearing protection isn’t required, but sometimes it can get loud, and I’d like to protect my hearing), and the ability to view notifications as they come in, especially if it’s from my Nest doorbell. I can quickly decline calls, and even scribble a quick text on the watch. I also use this at the gym, so that I can accurately track my workouts, and conveniently switch songs.You get a lot of options for the information that you want to show on the wallpaper, and you can adjust it right on the watch itself, instead of going through the app.The battery lasts me all day, like it should. I don’t like the feeling of wearing socks or long pants in bed, much less a watch, so I simply charge it at night. The charger itself is pretty cool, as it magnetically snaps onto the back of the watch.The only con for me, is the lack of a sapphire crystal for the screen. At this price, it should’ve been available on this model, and not just the pricier ones. I somehow managed to keep it from getting scratched at work, before finally buying some screen protectors a couple weeks later. Since it’s aluminum, I don’t feel the need to the protect the sides from getting scratched up. Polished stainless steel is another story, though. Absolute scratch magnet.I guess a longer battery life wouldn’t hurt either.I will also add that the 40mm case fits superbly on my 6” wrist. Overall, I’m very satisfied with my purchase. Unintentionally, I’ve even inspired some friends and family members to buy one for themselves.

    This is another great product from Apple.  They have made a lot of improvements since the series 5.  The response time of the watch is much faster than before (and it is actually slightly bigger as well).  It does a great job at keeping track of my steps, heart rate and sleeping.  It is very convenient when my phone is charging but I can at least see the messages I received from the watch and not have to go grab the phone every time.The only down side is that the battery needs to be charged about once a day (maybe a day in half sometimes).  I wish it was like the Fitbit where you can go 5-6 days between charges.

    The best Smart Watch money can buy. Like the rest of my Apple gadgets, I love my Apple Watch. The gentle haptic feedback for useful alerts makes the Watch experience a lot better. It’s the best accessory Apple has pioneered and it’s ahead of the competition for a long time to count. If you’re into smart watch, the best option is an Apple Watch. The solid feeling of the hardware and soft feeling of the software is incomparable to the rest.

    I had the 1st series before this and the difference is huge. Love this watch! I like that the screen stays on all the time. I don’t have an issue with the battery but I don’t play on my watch a lot. I text and check texts and sometimes I answer the phone on it but it’s more just a watch, check quick messages, and alarm for me. I feel it tracks your steps pretty well and the heart rate monitor is good. It also has some good features like fall detection and heart arrhythmia checks. I know there are a lot more features to this watch but I haven’t used them all but I really like this watch.

    I have had this for about 3 days and I LOVE it! I had a Fitbit for several years and what a change this is from that! So far, the only reason it has 4 stars is because of the short battery life.

So far, totally worth the $$$.

    The EKG feature is neat and the display looks nice. The heart rate detector feature looks fairly accurate as well. The only real complaint I have is the battery life is much shorter than the series 3. The battery life with the screen on all the time is approximately 1 day. GPS notifications tank it out very quickly. If you shut off the always on mode you can get approximately 2 days of battery life.

    This is the greatest device I've ever had. I do not wear it at night so I don't know how it would perform for sleep tracking. I use it to monitor my healthy activities i.e., moving, exercising, and standing. It communicates with my iPhone and the statistics are kept there. I use it for purchase payment and it's great not to drag a credit card out of my wallet to complete the transaction. It's great for telling time and the multiple watch faces make it customizable.

    It's definately the best watch if you looking for a good one. Little bit pricy compared to other brands but it is a smooth and perfectly pair with your iPhone. The only thing that I want to remind is the size. I tried in Apple Store for a short time and 40 mm is not the best option for me. After using few days you feel like it can be bigger. If you are using Apple devices like macbook and iphone this is the perfect option. I don't need to type my password for macbook which kind a cool.

    So my apple 2 watch died and I wanted to see if I could reduce my footprint - and buy a used/refurbished watch and upgrade.The watch works ok, but I have to consistently restart it as the screen becomes unresponsive. Like every other day. I do not expect this watch to last long and will not buy used again. Very disappointed and I do not expect that returning and trying again will work out any better so I will just reset it all the time until it quits on me.

The battery lasts not more than a day even though you just use to check notifications.

    Now this isn't going to be an in depth review about all of its pro and cons as everything in this world has them. But I am going to be very clear, this is not something you buy for the ""name"".There are many things that apple makes, and various other companies that are overpriced due to its ""name"" for a lack of better words. This is not one of them, not even close. It doesn't even compare to other watches, it is out of the norm and has crazy improvements and features over previous versions and other competitors.This is the best smart watch you can buy at this price, and honestly at any price. It is the most high quality product from apple, and you can see it in the end product. It is a master craft of watches, it is just down right amazing.

    Great watch. Love the new ECG app, and I really appreciate that Apple Watch will actually notify you of irregular heart rates and rhythms. Feels very sturdy and well made. Love the addition of an “always on” screen as it fully functions as a normal watch would now. Battery life is great and on par or slightly better than Series 3, even with the always on mode. The only thing that lacks is sleep tracking, however, there are 3rd party apps in the store that allow for it. I believe this is because sleep tracking is actually still very gimmicky and the sleep cycles are not accurately read on most smart watches. So until the science behind it catches up, I don’t see Apple implementing this on their own any time soon. I would recommend, more future proof than buying Series 3. This watch should carry you for a couple years or more before you feel the need upgrade.

The Fitbit ionic is far better for exercise tracker, watch.  My Fitbit battery is good for 3-5 days.  It has GPS is swimming proof, I get music from 2 different sources, on screen coaching, timer, alarm clock, everything I need in an easily accessible user friendly watch.Pros:Aesthetically pleasing.Single lead EKG capability (very limited & not worth the extra money)Apple Music capabilityCons:Battery life is non existent.

    I can't go a day with using it and not recharging it. have it on airplane mode and wifi off... still doesn't last. going to return return it and spend it on a quality watch. Don't need stuff... just want to track my runs and WOD's. EKG does not work in all area.

    This is an awesome ..... (I don't really want to call it a ""Watch"" because it is so much more!) Watch(?).  It actually detected a heart episode that I was having one night. It ran a EKG on me (when I put it on) and showed that I was having an irregular heart beat.  My Wife is a Nurse so she knew what to look for.  Luckily it wasn't serious, and this is NO SUBSTITUTE for Emergency medical care.  It also detected (what it thought was) a fall, and offered to call for help! This thing is amazing!  It was expensive, but I would recommend it.

    I love the apple watch for its fitness tracking and precise estimates, however the series 5 is a bit overkill.The apple watch series 3 does basically everything for less, but my work would pay for one for me so i picked the more expensive version. The only benefit of the series 5 is always on display. I never use the always on display as it kills your battery extremely quickly and i use this mostly as a fitness tracker. Sometimes if im going to an event i’ll turn AOD on and put on a nice watch face but otherwise, just buy a series 3 if you like apples ecosystem

    Was a little skeptical going from basic fitbit to the newest apple watch, very worth it, love it! Battery life is better than expected, I can usually go an average of a day and a half sometimes more on one charge. Nice to have all the features and health monitoring right on my wrist ! It is comfortable, and has not fallen off my wrist yet. Very convenient as a student to basically have a phone on my wrist, not as distracting to others while in class if I have to send a quick text or check an email on my wrist. Wonderful to pair with airpods and listen to music seperate from my phone. It also can lock itself when it senses it is not on your wrist, very useful security feature.

    I initially held off purchasing an Apple Watch because I thought, why do I need it?  I have a number of other Apple products and figured the watch was not needed.  Well, I have changed my mind.  I thoroughly enjoy having, and using, my watch.  I am fairly self-motivated, but the watch takes my fitness to another level.  If I have not completed my ""rings"" early in the afternoon, I get up, go for a walk, or go to the gym.  I want to keep my ""streak"" alive.  This feature alone, is enough for me to recommend the watch.  But also being able read emails, text messages, see the weather, my heart rate, etc. just adds to the usefulness of this device.  I am very pleased with this watch and recommend it highly to anyone who needs that little ""extra"" motivation to get up and go exercise.

    I’m an older woman living alone and my sons suggested I get this watch for safety reasons. With its fall detection and SOS capability I feel much more secure in my home. I love that I can get calls and texts without being glued to my phone. I’ve only had it for a few weeks so I’m sure there is much more to learn and features to take advantage of but so far I love it!

    I use this watch primarily for running and working out. The GPS is awesome, I used to have a Garmin forerunner but the satellite took FOREVER to load and it was not super accurate. Love that the maps on this watch are great and it takes zero time to load. Tracking workouts is awesome, it also has pretty much every workout you could think of. Definitely recommend for athletes.

    I love my Apple Watch. I ended up returning the black and purchasing the white. I find it difficult to find after market bands with the same silver. This watch is amazing and lasts all day if I charge. I feel naked without it on and wish the battery could last a full 24! The constant connectivity takes some getting used to. Now I have no excuse when I ignore people because they know I have seen their messages. The 40 mm is perfect for a female wrist but too small for a male. The Included Apple band is much nicer quality than some extras I’ve gotten off of amazon. The constant notifications can be a bit distracting.

    I hesitated for years when the iwatches were launched. Not this year, I finally bought it. So many features! You can adjust the features to your preference, such a neat toy! I even bought a sophisticated watch band with bling bling and to this day, I receive many compliments. If you’re an Apple fan, you should definitely buy the watch.

    This new Apple Watch series 5 I have to say that it’s amazing. The point of a watch is to tell time at any time. Many smart watches lack that. Finally now we have this watch that never blacks out but the screen is on every time. I have to say this is an amazing watch I bought. The battery is way better than the older models plus I have been swimming in it and no damage at all.

    The Apple Watch didn’t change much from previous versions. If you are a fan of them you will enjoy this one as well. I discovered the walkie-talkie, a feature that is on all modes that allows you to use your watch as a walkie-talkie. This is convenient but not necessary since you can make phone calls with your watch. Overall the watch is great but unless you have to have the 5 wait for the 6 because it should have more upgrades.

    My wife loves it. It was $15 cheaper on amazon, and arrived the next morning. This was a just-because upgrade for her, the always on display is nice, and the new options for heart rate are a nice touch. Kudos to Apple. The design is no different than my series 3, or her previous series 1, but that’s Apple.

    This has more features than I expected. The only downer is that you have to download a separate app for sleep tracking and the battery isn’t that great for 24hr wear. I have to charge at night to ensure a good charge for the next day. But that was to be expected so I didn’t downgrade the rating for it.

    This is my first Apple Watch, and I bought this mainly because of the EKG and the other sensors. I wanted to buy the Series 4 but the Apple discontinued, so I took the Series 5 and thanks to the Amazon I could save around $55 on it (gift card refill bonus - $10, prime now first order coupon code - $10, amazon credit card 5% bonus - $20 and the cheeper base price - 15$). :D

    Screen broke and cracked.  The watch bezel is not very robust. It won’t take much if any abuse. Be sure to pay an extra $79 for Apple Care plus $69 for each of the 2 support issues. the iWatch 2 and iWatch 3 had cracking issues. The watch 5 is prone to crack. The iWatch 5 GPS with Cellular is not a keeper. Infact it’s a disposable watch once broken. Apple engineered it so it can’t be fixed. It looks like I’m out $360 for the repair or I’m selling the cracked iWatch 5 on Craigslist for $80. Another piece of Apple Junk  don’t buy this product it’s not well made and can’t be repaired. Only replaced. CHINESE JUNK.

    I REALLY love the various heart monitoring apps that this one does! I have had some heart issues, and the heartrate and EKG options reassure me.It is also at least as good as the Fitbit for things like keeping track of steps.Plus, it tells the time! LOL!It is a bit tricky to figure out at first, and also has very little documentation on how to use it... but it's not all that hard to figure out, plus there is lots of info online about how to do various things.Mine does require a connection to an iphone; this may be an issue if you do not have one.Still- while I am still playing around with the options- I do love it!

    If you have a wrist tattoo don’t even bother with the Apple watch. I’ve tried the last three versions and the watch just constantly asks for my passcode. The watch can’t read through a tattoo making wrist detection unavailable. Apple has known about this since the very first Apple Watch but they apparently don’t care enough to fix the issue.

    I just got this to replace my versa Fitbit, as far as a swim tracker goes this watch is a joke. I swim daily as part of my fitness routine and like to track my lap pace. This doesn’t track accurately at all, I do like the heart rate tracking it does but that’s about it. All the other features aren’t really important to me. So it’s going back.

    The watch is great. I have tried MANY cheaper smart watches and I have to say this one is very well appointed. And if I got to used it for the whole day without taking it off and charging it, it would be even better. I want to track  my sleep with it so that means I cant charge it overnight. They also have many write-ups on how you to make your battery last longer by, well... basically downgrading the function of the watch!! here you can make it not make so many motions and not light as long and not update and not this and not that... but I WANT THE WATCH TO DO all it can do!!!  I do not have any idea why by generation #5 they can't make a battery that definitely lasts 24 hours. I charged mine last night to 100%, slept with it on (and it tracked my sleep great), did an hour of cardio this morning and I have it checking my heart rate all day. It is 5PM and I have 4% left.  Inexcusable!  At the very least they could create a charging system that you could attach while you wear it, which I think I have seen on the Pebble, where it magnets to the side. AND the charging takes 2 HOURS!!!  seriously? so basically I am wearing this for maximum 22 hours a day AND then I don't actually get 22 hours of battery out of it. For the money? I am not nearly as happy with it as I am my XS MAX. So if you want a watch that can do only some of what it can do, go ahead and buy it.UPDATE: 10/29/2019 - I decided to try turning off the active face. My battery lasts plenty to get through the day and I have to charge it while watching tv at night and then I wear it through the night to track sleep. (which there are AWESOME sleep tracking apps for BTW, you have NO idea how your sleep patterns really are until you use these things... Sleep is way more than just being unconscious for 6-8 hours..  so I updated my rating to a 5.Things Ive learned I like about it: When I am at my computer and my phone is not, and I go to a site that needs 2 factor codes? The watch gets them. If my phone isnt close.. I can answer a call on it, and the person cant even really tell. The watch reminds me when I have been a LAZY ASS all day and I have now met my activity rings 4 times later in the night because it egged me on so I would go for a ""brisk walk"". Its a simple goal to want to achieve your daily rings.. but its such a good thing.  when you get a text, answering with your voice is nice and easy.  Pictures are however close to worthless on it..Buy one!!

    This is a hasty review and I'll update it if warranted. So far, this watch is absolutely terrible for music. Loading music literally takes hours. There is no documentation about how much music can be loaded. 5GB? 10GB? Who knows? And the music app has no equalizer. The 3rd-party music apps with equalizers that are supposedly for the watch are apparently just extensions that allow one to control the app on their iPhone from their watch. Totally useless.I want the watch to be a replacement for my Fitbit and to play music so that I don't have to carry my iPhone with me at the gym. So far, no go.

    I had purchased the first Apple watch that came out back in 2017 (Series 3) and loved it. When I saw this one being released, I decided to upgrade.  My previous watch was stainless steel, it felt heavier on my wrist than my current Apple watch. I got the Series 5 space gray aluminum case, black sport band, 40mm GPS only. I love it. Beautiful watch, I felt kinda naked while waiting for it, since I've sold my previous watch LOL If you want to upgrade from Series 3 to something newer,  I just recommend upgrading to the Series 5! =)

    I moved up from a series 3, which I've enjoyed, to this one. I ordered it Thursday morning & it arrived on Saturday. The band from my old watch fit this one perfectly & the always on display is WONDERFUL! Apple could sell this thing for less if they were to scale back on the high-dollar packaging, but they would never doing anything like that.
  
"

    Upgraded from the Series 3 to the Series 5. Gotta say I was a little skeptical at first, but this watch exceeded my expectations. This watch feels much lighter than the 3 and the display on the 5 is far super to my former watch. Would recommend if you're an iOS user and you're upgrading from the series 3 or lower or don't have an Apple Watch yet.  My only complaint is that the battery life feels more or less the same. If it lasted at least 2-3 hours longer, it'd be perfect.

    I have been a Fitbit user for 5 years. After having multiple issues with them I decided to look into other tracker options. I went with the Apple Watch because it seemed to have most of what I was looking for and I also already owned other Apple products. There are some differences between the Fitbit and the Apple Watch. The battery life is definitely shorter than the Fitbit but it lasts longer than the day. I used to wear my Fitbit to track sleep but I don’t wear the Apple Watch to bed. I put it on early in the morning and it stays on the entire day. At the end of the day there is still plenty of battery life left so I could potentially wear it to sleep but then would have to charge in the morning. You can’t do group challenges on the Apple Watch like you can with the Fitbit but you can do one on one challenges with friends. Something that has taken getting used to is the Apple watches main goal is not step tracking. You can still easily view your step count but it’s not one of the goals you have to reach. It’s based of closing 3 rings. The exercise ring is a little hard at times to close. If you don’t swing your arms enough while walking it will not count exercise. It’s nice being able to take calls on it as well as receive and reply to texts. I think it is a little heavier than the Fitbit was (the last Fitbit I had was the Versa) but it’s not weighing my arm down or anything.All in all I am happy I made the switch and I enjoy the program, app and functionality of it.

    I bought my first fitness tracker, a Fitbit, a few years ago because it was cheap- $100. It was so inaccurate, had horrible battery life, and I could not sleep with it on because it would get stuck on the sheets at night. After it failed, I bought a Garmin thinking it was better. I gave it 11 months then threw it away. It kept telling me I was doing 11 flights of stairs on my drive home after 3 weeks of use and my hand would fall asleep when it would jam on blankets in the middle of the night.Then my SO bought a series 4. I told her it was a waste and they wouldn't like it or find a use for it. After a year they loved it and couldn't do without it. So I bought a series 5 on sale with my bonus check.WHY DIDNT I DO THIS YEARS AGO!!!????? I love this thing. It took a whole to figure out how to use it, but that's expected for electronics. I get 24hrs out of a full charge with daily activities and also a 1hr GYM routine. It takes about 1hr or so to fully charge with Ipad charger and wireless charger. I can do my 2FA codes from my watch in a second without needing to whip out my phone and unlock it and open the app etc.. Siri is 10x better on the watch than my iPhone. It's comfortable to wear overnight and the sleep apps you can download are very nice and accurate. Now when I workout I can check my heart rate accurately and also add-in a more accurate calorie count than before. I just love this thing. I was well worth the $380. Just make sure you get a screen protector on it right away as the screen can scratch in an instant with daily tasks like bumping your car or reaching into a cabinet for a pan.

    I got this Apple 5 watch for my wife and daughter at Christmas.  So far, they both wear the watch most of the time.  My daughter tells me she is digging the watch more each day.  The wife, she is not sure what the watch does yet.Hey, it's cheaper than a Rolex, which my wife has 3 sitting in a winder box that never get worn either.

    I bought this for the ""fall detection"". It worked on 1 occasion, and missed on 2 others. 2 out of three were ""hard"" falls.

    The watch itself is great but it just  would not hold a charge. I would put it on when I woke up fresh off the charger( forget sleep tracking because this thing needs to be on the charger at night) and it would die by that evening before I even got home from work ( about 12 hours).  This rendered it pretty  much useless and more of a hassle than anything since I was constantly worried about conserving the battery or charging it.

    I love the watch!  Can’t track my sleep because you have to charge it at night.  Charge only lasts a day.  Both of those things are a disappointment on such an expensive watch.  My garmins all lasted longer and tracked sleep.  But it really is a great watch

    I wanted one of these for the integration with my phone.  Previously, I was a Fitbit user which has better fitness applications including sleep analysis.  Turns out, I need a separate app for sleep analysis with this watch.  The strap is awkward for me to use so I bought a third party one.  Overall, I like the watch and will continue using it.

    This is my first Apple Watch so I can’t compare it to a former version. It was delivered one day after Apple released them. So far it has performed well, and I haven’t had any problems. The battery lasts 16 hours and is only down to 50 %. I’m not sure if that’s good or not. I like the heart monitoring capability. That’s good for exercising. I also like the compass.

    Originally bought this for my wife, since she always leaves her phone laying around on silent while I’m at work. Let’s just say it fixed the never being able to reach her and so much more. I quickly bought one for myself and love it. Highly recommend!

    I purchased this primarily for the Heart Rate and Fall sensors, GPS, and SOS. I had regular nice watches already.I wanted to write this to say that for one year of paying for a medical alert system that may not work outside your home or one that you have to be conscious to push a button on - you could buy this watch and have it for years to come with no other costs.

    Got this for my teenage son for Christmas. It’s been durable, but he takes good care of his belongings. The most impressive use of the wTch has been his interest in tracking his health & fitness. He has changed his eating & snacking habits & development an exercise regimen to stay in a healthy zone.As well, I get a quicker response to my calls & messages because it is on his wrist.

    I've never had an apple watch. I never thought I'd want one. Then I saw it at Best Buy. They told me it came out last week, I was intrigued. And I felt I deserved something for myself.My initial review was a 3-star, disappointed review. But after having it for a few days more and getting some explanations about a few things, this is my mended review and hopefully it helps avoid frustrations as you upgrade from no watch or upgrade from previous versions. I will not discuss the obvious new features like always on screen, etc. which you can read elsewhere. This is my account from usage… by someone who never had or wanted an apple watch and is trying to figure this thing out.MusicYou can download music onto your Apple Watch for offline use with the GPS unit/or for plane travel. However, you have to use iTunes/Apple Music app. This requires a sub. $5 if you a student/$10 regularly. I got a 3 month trial & Verizon also gives 6 month trials if you have them. I'm hoping to get a 9 month trial... not sure yet if that will work.Apple Music has two apps. Apple Radio, which looks like ((o)) or something like that (I couldn’t figure out where it was, even after searching for Apple Radio and other iterations of that). That's for your saved radio stations along with some default ones.The other app is a music note, which holds playlists, songs, artists, and albums. This app has two folders. ‘On phone’ and ‘library’. On phone literally plays music off your phone like a blue tooth speaker, which I was so lost for the first day. I couldn’t figure out why it wasn’t playing from the watch headphones when I was in the wrong folder.The library folder plays downloaded music that’s on your watch.The Radio app is cool, but seems really buggy. If you use iTunes to add music stations, it seems to add some and ignore others. If you accidentally add one, you are stuck with it, no way to remove it on iTunes or on the watch. I'm new to Apple Music so it's taken some getting used to.So if you search for Fun., add the station, it may or may not show up in your stations. And instead of giving you a radio section, they give you a recently played stations section in iTunes, so who knows after picking the stations you like, if they will exist in the future.Spotify is non-existent. There is an app, but you have to have your phone to play it. And it plays off your phone like it's a speaker. And you can't download music from Spotify onto your phone. -one of the reasons I got this and something I thought I could do. Spotify claims to be working on it, but I think it's more Apple forcing Apple Music. Might as well just use your phone for Spotify. Pandora you must be on wifi, so not good to use if you plan to leave connection areas. I pay for Spotify, I don't pay for Pandora. So premium may work differently, but I doubt it. I deleted both these apps and unfortunately sticking with Apple Music/Radio despite them both having major flaws. I'm embarrassed for them.When downloading music for offline use, it downloads over blue tooth. It's sooooo slow. And that is an understatement. Download overnight if possible. And I recommend researching ‘downloading through the wifi’. The apple watch app forces Blue tooth/wifi to be on, but I found when I did the wifi work around (after googling it), it downloaded my playlists fully in 20-30 minutes (well it missed a few songs, but more or less it got most of them). Doing it over blue tooth, I would wake up in the morning with nothing downloaded, which has happened twice. Might be the biggest thorn for the device. And one I can’t figure out after 5 iterations why it’s not better… Despite downplaying this, I spent hours trying to figure this out and I settled on having ""Most of my songs"" I want on the device.Especially with fitness and working out being a big selling point for this, they have a lot of improvement to do in regards to the music, which to me is shocking. It’s hard to believe the blatant downfalls of its music eco system with this and seems more like an apple dictatorship of them saying ‘No one can download music on here unless they pay for apple music’ and ‘how terrible can we make this and still make people pay’. Like in the movie Trading Places when the two old rich guys bet the $1, I imagine it being like that, but with people paying for a terrible service.No music can play over the watch, so you must use blue tooth headphones.MUSIC on the Apple watch 5 is a gigantic huge fail. And that was one of the reasons I gave this a go. The software is akin to my mid 90's MP3 player... okay... okay... I'll move on.Apps:The apps are watered down versions of their iPhone counterparts. Most of them seem to require opening them up on your connected iPhone so that the watch can connect to it. So before leaving home without your phone, I would make sure all apps you plan to use have been synced up and at least opened on the watch. Some apps really shine which I will put my list of apps I like below, some are a bit more frustrating with their lack of controls, which the settings are more or less controlled on the phone and synced over.Cellular vs. GPSThis is a question I struggled with. I bought the Cellular version, which I was on the fence whether to connect it. I have Verizon. The cost is as follows based on what I’m paying:Monthly $10 + $4.35 taxes & fees = $14.35/mo1 time activation = $40First month just paying the $4.35, they waived the first month service fee.I called and waited on hold for over three hours to get the activation waived. At some point in there, it was more about the principle. Probably not worth the time wasted, but spending $575 on the GPS + cellular Apple Watch, every nickel counts. I got the activation down to $20, then they instructed me to call another rep to credit me the $20. They credited my account $20… not sure why the first rep couldn't do that as well. Whatever helps Verizon sleep at night. Just be as polite and kind as possible. They have the upper hand and they know it (although the reps were seemingly helpful). I basically got the whole activation fee waived, but it was a very annoying and long process.Having cellular has encouraged me to get a slimmer wallet. Earbuds. And a s-biner to remove keys I’m not using. Not needing a phone is gold, especially as they continue to grow. It felt really free to go on my walk and make calls or text without it. Streaming the apple radio stations was nice too, I gave a few stations a listen to that I normally wouldn’t have. Having cell service on my daily walk is nice, especially leaving the bulky phone behind.You can also use Siri with cell service (only GPS=no Siri if not connected to the phone). That’s a big way to communicate with the watch. Like adding calendar items, reminders, or simply adding astronomically weird numbers together you are just curious about. Siri acts stupid without the cell service, “Working on it…” “Hmm, I can’t do that right now”By the way, calendar items can only be deleted and edited through the phone or computer. Apple Watch is limited to adding items. But you can view the calendar which is nice keeping on task.So while I was on the fence about going the extra mile with getting cellular service, I think if you do get this product, it’s like having a phone without service. It’s cool, still has a lot of functionality, but it falls short of its full capability.As for the phone call screen, you can’t talk on the phone and check texts/emails at the same time. The phone screen stays on the watch until call ends.It can call Emergency, SOS, etc. without the cell service. And my understanding is, cellular service doesn’t work if you travel internationally with it. But should have same functionality as if you called using your phone in regards to calling international.I suggest going cellular. It gets pricey, but I plan to restructure my subscriptions to balance it out. I have a feeling in a lot of ways, this will replace my phone.Nike vs. StandardGet the Nike. The body looks the same. Functions the same. With additional 3-4 faces (my favorite faces I use) and comes with a sports band, one with holes to keep your wrist from getting toooo sweaty (still a little sweaty if it’s hot, but could be worse with the other band). The band is really nice soft silicon, but I thought it had a pulse reader in it based on the silver disk. There is no mechanics in the band and that turned out to be the watch latch. The faces have a nike logo which can be pressed to go directly to the Nike Run Club app. You hit the logo, hit play. And it records your miles, your pace (minutes per mile), and shows a little drawing shape of where you went. It alerts you at every mile to update your minutes/mile and at the end validates your hard work with a fun little phrase. I didn’t care about this app at first, but I use it daily, even on my walks. I believe the app comes with both versions, but the nike has the logo shortcut. Just get the Nike. Why not.Favorite Apps:Seven $5/mo – workout app that gives you different workouts in a seven minute increment. It’s a paid app, but on the watch, it’s been a really cool one, with little animations.Apple Music/Radio $10/mo – by default, because no other apps have real true music capability despite this one kind of being terrible.Nike Run Club $0 – Tracks your miles you run/walk with a pace. Pauses when you are stopped and continues as you go.Find My Car $1 – After you park, just open that up and hit the button, and puts a ping and address where you parked to find your car.World Clock $0 – Allows you to add cities all over the world so you know what time it is thereRoadtrippers $0- Shows places around you like restaurants, entertainment, attractions, etc.ESPN $0 – go on your phone and choose your sports teams as your favorites and it alerts you when they are playing and the channel (I’ve been told there is news as well, but I haven’t found a news section on the watch)Fantastical ?$ - I already had this one so can’t remember what I paid, but happy it ported over. Nice app to have.Wallet $0 – No need to bring your wallet with your digital credit card. Not accepted everywhere yet, which is a huge bummer.Some people have recommended Dark Skies $3.99, but not sure I want to spend $4 on a weather app. Still looking for a dietary app to help me pick recipes. I found a few, but I’m not paying a month sub for a dietary app.If you have found apps you particularly like, please leave in the comments so people can download and discover new ones!HardwareThe buttons are super responsive. It’s nice to turn the wheel and feel the little clicks. And the side button is nice. The wheel selects and enter items. The side button is different from the phone, so it does take a little getting used to. The side button below the wheel is your favorite/recent apps. Which you can change in your apple watch iPhone app. I put them in as my favorites instead of recents, and after doing that, I began to like the watch more. I didn’t understand that button until my watch sales rep told me that function. You can put 10 favorites and one most recent pops up at the top, which is perfect.The screen is beautiful, responsive. Not much more to say about that. Sometimes it doesn’t wake up even when brought to face, so that’s a bit annoying as sometimes it doesn’t wake Siri. I sometimes have to throw my wrist down and bring it back up, I’m hoping I start getting the hang of that. And Siri doesn’t always catch what I say, and repeating myself is lame in front of crowds.CompassI will mention one feature that’s new is the compass. This helps direct the GPS maps to the direction you are facing/walking, which after learning that, I appreciated that feature much more.Watch faces are all customizable and there are a lot to choose from. They call complications the items on the face to take you to certain apps or the shortcuts. You can add weather or dates or run club or several others in the complications section on the face. Just customize the face of the watch by pressing firmly on the face until the customize button pops up.BatteryBattery lasted about 9 hours today with fairly consistent use between calls, texting, setting up cellular, and music. I charged it for 45 minutes after it died and it put me back at 50%. If the watch is dead, you can hold the ‘on button’ for 5 seconds for it to read a simple time reading, which is nice.BrowsingNo web browser. You can open pages, but they are all text pages and viewing pages are done through links sent (unless I haven’t discovered how to do this yet). Searching is done all by voice through Siri. I wish there was at least a scribble function with Siri so maybe you can ask smaller questions without having to speak into it at a the grocery store, etc. or if its not hearing correctly. Editing what you said would be a nice function too if Siri thinks you said something else.One last note/suggestion:If you care about getting a certain watch band, buy at an Apple. You can choose the band the watch comes with there at the store. Some bands may or may not be in stock, but when I bought mine, they ‘customized’ my order and came out 7 minutes later with my watch/choosen band in a bag. The whole transaction took less than ten minutes. I felt like I was robbed by how fast they took $575 from me.So it’s been a wild first week of having the apple watch. I went from having on my calendar to return the watch on the last day returns are allowed to signing up for the cell service and looking into other bands and accessories. It cost of it does seem to add up. I’m looking forward to getting past the purchase with my bank account, but I’m also excited to start utilizing it in my daily life.If you found this review to be helpful, please hit that helpful button below. Don’t forget to add a comment with your favorite apple watch apps or thoughts on my review. Pictured is the one I purchased, my face is cooler than that one.

    Apple Watch, Series 5 GPS 40mm with black sport band: This is my first smart watch. It was easy to set up and pair with an iPhone 8. You will need an iPhone to pair with it. You'll have a ""watch"" app on your phone in which you can change settings and access data. Most liked feature is that the watch notifies me of text messages and phone calls so I know if I want to dig out my phone to answer right away. It also allows me to turn off any alarms I have set on my phone with a tap on the watch face. I didn't like any of the numerous watch face choices. I wanted just a simple day, date and digital time, but that is not an option. (The Apple website shows all the choices, if that's a dealbreaker.) It is a little too easy to inadvertently touch the watch face, which will often open an app or audibly provide the time. Another annoyance is the workout app notifying you when it thinks you've stopped and might have finished your workout or when it wants to congratulate you for meeting its pre-set 30 minute exercise goal. Indoors, this isn't a big deal. But when Nordic Walking in the snow with big mitts and pole straps on, when the watch dings, it is tedious to have to stop, unstrap, and pull off the mitt only to find a unnecessary message. The battery is usually half used up by the end of the day, so I charge it every night. It has a ""nightstand"" mode where it will display the time in big numbers while charging if you want to use it as your nightstand clock. The sport band is reasonably comfortable and easy to put on with one hand. Overall, it seems like a quality device.

    I love it! I never thought I’d buy an apple watch but now I’m a believer. IOS 6 works well. Note that you’ll need an iPhone 6s Plus or higher for the series 5 watch to work.And I noticed today that the watch GPS will direct me while driving. Very cool!

    I purchased this Apple Watch as new.  When I was trying to get it up and running I couldn’t get past it’s pass words to set it up.  I called Apple and spent at least an hour trying to get it to work.  Finally the Apple expert asked me where I had gotten it.  I said Amazon.  She told me that the watch couldn’t be set up in my name because it had previously been owned and still had the previous owners pass words etc which prevented me from being able to use it.  Amazon sold it as new when it was not.  I returned the watch and Amazon gave me a $400.00 credit to use on Amazon.  They didn’t inform me they had done this.  I don’t want a credit.  I want my money back.  I am still trying to get my money but so far no luck.

    I had a series 1 previously and the only thing I really wanted it for was for letting me know I have messages while at work. I have found I really love always on display, the feel of the watch, and the battery life.It’s a really great watch. I got it on sale around Black Friday with the thought I probably wouldn’t love it but I changed my mind and will definitely be keeping it!I wish you could customize it more but overall I really love not having to flick my wrist to see my info.

    Love my Apple Watch. The app is great and I complete all my circles daily. It does need to be charged every night and does not track your sleeping habits. For very active people and athletes it’s great! For those needing a device to contact emergency personnel from a fall or heart problem it’s comforting to have this Watch!

    I got this for my wife to replace her series 1 watch.  The performance increase is substantial compared to her series 1.  The always on display was the main reason I got this over the Series 4 as there isn’t much change besides that with the two.It would get a 5 out of 5 if it weren’t for the price,  it’s too much in my opinion.  Should be $50/$100 cheaper but overall it’s a great smart watch, definitely the best out there

    Bought this for my fiancé because she loves watches but wasn't sure if she really wanted one or just thought she did. She absolutely loves this thing. She's a teacher and she can set timers for her students, make phone calls without grabbing her phone, and easily respond to messages. She's not into tech stuff at all, but when she opened it up she acted like that kid opening up that Nintendo 64 in that viral video

    Love this watch! Actually like the size better than my first Apple Watch which was a 42mm.  This is a 40mm.  More intuitive than my first watch.  Like the idea of the watch face staying on all the time, just slightly dimming until you raise the watch to look at it.  Also like the watch being a little more Waterproof than my first watch.  Too many upgraded features to mention.  If you haven’t upgraded or this is the first watch you choose to buy, you won’t be disappointed!

    I was a long time Fitbit enthusiast and fan. Spent a good 5 years with the Fitbit Charge HR that served me really well and helped me lose significant weight. I literally ran it into the ground till it fell apart piece by piece and I had to upgrade. My options were to go for the new Versa 2 or the Apple Watch. Unforunately for Fitbit over their last 4-5 releases including the Versa 1 all of their reviews have been horrendous. People have complained about cheap quality, to syncing issues, to software issues and what not. And then I started seeing the early Versa 2 reviews come in and those were abyssmal as well. Therefore I ponied up a few extra benjamins and went for the AWS5And I am glad to say this thing does not disappoint. My biggest concern moving away from the Fitbit ecosystem to Apple was the stupid rings or at least I thought they were stupid. But I now find the ring system pretty good an intuitive. Some of the things that work very well for me are things such as extensive heart health analysis including HR recovery post workout. It has many other metrics and of course the ECG which is very helpful to know that your heart is operating in a good way. The one thing I don't like about the Apple Watch is its integration of food calories or rather its lack thereof. One thing I LOVED about the Fitbit was how it was all a one-stop-shop view for your food calories, your active calories, your exercise calories and sleep score etc. But in Apple you have to flip flop between a 3rd party app like Lose It or MyFitnessPal and then go into the Health App to see your health and heart stats and then the activity app to see your activity. You get my point, right? It just seems all over the place and very cubersome to go into 3 different things that you could do with one FitBit app.But that annoyance aside the AWS5 does so many things that are great. Its notifications are great. Its GPS is great. The way you can control music while being on a run is great. The stats it displays for things like a outside run or biking and even weight training is great. The HR monitor is very good and the Siri function (as dumb as she is) is very good on the Watch.Overall I am really liking this watch and have figured out a pretty good way to replicate my experience as close to what my experience was with Fitbit. I have to give kudos to Fitbit for creating a very seamless app experience for the fitness enthusiast. But with a little bit of research and finagling I have been able to get my AW experience pretty close to my FitBit app experience by using 3rd party apps such as Lose It and along with a host of extra features I am glad I went for the Apple Watch vs. the Versa 2 which seems to be getting bad reviews.

    This apple watch has been my everyday device since when I first received it. This has been a very useful device, especially when making/receiving phone calls when my phone isn't near. What I love the most about this watch compared to my old one the series 3 is the always-on display (First image is the always-on display and the second image is when the display is fully on) as I can look at the time anytime without fully turning on the display of the apple watch.However, when it boils down to sleep tracking it isn't the best at sleep tracking mainly because of the battery life as I get roughly 20% left before heading to sleep, I wake up at 5:30AM and end my day usually around 9-10PM. I wish the battery life lasted longer so I can use this watch as my sleep tracker and not needing to always charge it around 10PM as on weekends I tend to go out where I have to leave my watch at home.When it comes down to design I really like it a lot especially how the display is bigger compared to my series 3, the bad part is where the heart sensor is between the cracks it tends to get dirty where when cleaning it this can be a difficult task to clean as it's between the cracks where the heart sensor is and the body as shown in the image.Overall, I do like the series 5 and hopefully, they can improve their design when they release the new apple watch. I do recommend this product especially if you're buying this as a gift as this is a perfect gift for an iPhone user.

    I switched from Fitbit because of privacy concerns, but this watch isn’t good for fitness.  You can’t customise it,  the music doesn’t work with Spotify, even if songs are downloaded, it doesn’t keep your heart rate on the screen when exercising, and the steps are hidden in a secondary screen you have to scroll to.  This might be good for people who can’t live without seeing texts rog  away, but how the hell is it going to track sleep when you have to charge it every 10 hours?
